    One of the biggest questions that has always been asked is what is our Credit System. 
    As many of you know Credits are 100% exclusive to 2009scape. But what are credits you ask?
    Credits are the 2009scape's currency for rare items. Is it like a donator shop? With it's own 
    custom interface you won't be mistaken that it has anything to do with any custom private server.
    Credits are our way of saying thank you for doing something. I'm going to go over all the different 
    methods of earning credits.

<b><u>Voting</u></b>
<p> Everyone who has been actively a part of discord understands that this may be by far the easiest way to earn 
    a credit. All you need to do in order to get a credit is vote on Rune locus. You may ask yourself the question 
    why do we want you to vote? how does this help us? The higher we get on the list the more exposure we may get to 
    get more players in return this helps contribute to building the server. Every so often our discord bot will post 
    the link to vote but if it hasn't and you'd like the link just use the command ::vote inside of discord. 
    Once you've voted, take a screenshot of your page, and then post inside of the #claim-to-fame section of Discord.
    <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  After you have voted you will receive a total of one credit every 12 hours so this method could easily earn you an average
  of 60 credits a month. In March of 2021 we have introduced a new system called our voting streak system which if a player 
  has voted for seven consecutive days you will recieve five credits for your first vote on your seventh day. Once you've 
  earned the streak it starts over at day one for you to get it again the following week by voting all week again. Keep in 
  mind for the voting streak you only need to vote once a day. We are based off of California time for how I'm reporting days. 
  This might mean for people over seas that your end of the day will not be California's end of the day therefore you will 
  still have a bit more time for you to vote. If you miss a day of voting your voting streak will be reset and you will need 
  to vote seven days in a row all over again.
</p>
<b><u> Hall of Fame </u></b>
<p> Ah yes, we have made it to the pride and joy of a game where our accomplishments are not only rewarded by a fantastic skill cape 
or bragging rights but also can claim your right to the first to a 99 in a skill and get credits and recognition on our website for 
their achievements. It is determined by different different experience rates and ironman modes to determine how many credits someone
may get. 
<br/> 
These Hall of fame rewards were completely rewritten to fit the amount of effort one puts into their account.
                                                               </p><ul>
<li><b>x1 xp rate</b>: 200 credits</li>
<li><b>x2.5 xp rate</b>: 100 credits</li>
<li><b>x5 xp rate</b>: 40 credits</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Contributions </u></h3>
<p>
Our project was reopened as open source in June of 2021 and will forever stay this way. If you are a contributor there are a few guidelines you need to follow in 
order to make sure that you are not doing all of this working for nothing.
<br>
<br>
 <b><u>Pull Requests</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Developers are expected to make all changes in their own forks/branches and create a pull request to the main repository with their contributions. If you do not know what these are or how to do them, look at the gitlab documentation. 
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Staying up to Date</u></b>
<br>
<br>
Developers are expected to have their forks/branches fully up to date before submitting pull requests in order to avoid merge conflicts. 
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Server Playerscripts</u></b>
<br>
<br>
New bot scripts must undergo a thorough review before being allowed into the game. The criteria for an acceptable botscript are as follows: 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The script should not enable the automated farming of any high level items, materials or resources.</li>
  <li>The script should be designed to automate some boring task or grind</li>
  <li>The script should not offer active advantages to other players other than offering for sale low level resources on the grand exchange.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Credits for Contributors</u></b>
<br>
<br>
When an issue is created on our Gitlab page's issue tracker, a staff member will assign a certain number of credits they believe it to be worth. Should the issue be fixed by a contributor and fully merged into the codebase, the person who reported the issue will receive a credit, and the person who fixed the issue will receive the full amount of credits listed for the issue. Only in very rare circumstances will a contribution that doesn't address a listed issue result in a credit reward, as a staff member did not have adequate time to assign that issue a credit value. 
<br>
<br>
Should an issue be fixed by the same person who reported it, they will receive the listed credit amount plus the bonus credit for the initial report. This is just to keep things simple. 
<br>
<br>
The main thing a player or contributor should take away from this is that reporting bugs the proper way is very important, and focusing on already-reported bugs when decided what to fix is equally important. 
<br>
<br>
Contributions for new content, like adding a new quest or minigame, or adding some other piece of content that was plainly missing/never implemented, will function differently and will receive a credit reward based on a careful evaluation of the time and effort as well as the quality of the contribution. A small and very well written quest might have a very worthwhile reward, while a large and poorly written quest might give substantially less credits than one might expect. Quality is better than quantity here. 
<br>
<br>
</p>
<b><u> Quest Dialogue </u></b>
<p>
  Similar to the JSON contributions this is the next way you can help without needing to know how to program. There are several 
  youtubers who have videos from 2008-2009 where you can see the dialogue word for word through their chat options. This is the 
  number one preferred way since it keeps it the most accurate to 2009. You can use OSRS as a reference but please be careful doing 
  this incase OSRS has changed something and didn't document it well. By doing this you are speeding up the developer's time by 
  getting all the dialogue together and will be rewarded with 10 credits.
</p>
<b><u> Events </u></b>
<p>
    In 2009 a lot of us played the game because it was a fun game that we could come home to and play with our friends. The game had just 
    as much a social aspect as it did a grind aspect. 
    <br/>
    Official Server events that are hosted by <b style="color: darkgreen">Kermit</b>,
    will come with a reward of credits as well. If you attend one of the server events you will get 5 credits for participation to be motivation 
    to set the grind aside to come have some fun. 
    <br/>
    Player Hosted Offical Events : Can vary from house parties, to bossing events, etc. To bring more people together instead of being 
    a constant player 1 skills on this side of the map and player 2 skills on that side of the map we want to encourage you to create your own events. 
    Do note to take these serious because all events will be filtered/needing approval from our Frog. 
    It is five credits per player for attending said events and it is 2 credits per person that shows up for the person hosting the event on top of
    your participation. Player hosted will be announced offically once but it's up to the player to fully plan out the event.
