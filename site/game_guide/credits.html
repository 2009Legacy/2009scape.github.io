  Our Credit system is our reward system for contributing towards the project in various ways. You must not confuse it with a 
  donation system that another server may have. It's our way of saying thank you for your contributions and an incentive to continue by
  turning them into a currency to buy the holiday rares that everyone loves.

<b><u>Voting</u></b>
<p> Everyone who has been active in our discord/matrix understands that this may be by far the easiest way to earn credits.
     To start receiving credits for voting you must vote on Runelocus. Why vote? When a player votes there is a small chance that someone may recognize our 
    server on the top rsps list and stop by to relive their younger years. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>For Discord Users</b>
    <br>
    You can find the link for the voting website in the 
    handy links section of discord. Once you've voted, take a screenshot of your page, and then post inside of the #claim-to-fame section of Discord.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>For Matrix Users</b>
    <br>
    You can find the link under the Community tab on the website and click "Vote!" it will redirect you to a new page. Once you have voted, take a screenshot of the page, 
    and then post your screenshot inside of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#09-claimtofame:matrix.org">#claim-to-fame</a> channel for Matrix.

  <br>
  <br>
  After you have voted you will receive a total of one credit every 12 hours so this method could easily earn you an average
  of 60 credits a month. In March of 2021, we have introduced a new system called our voting streak system. Our Streak system, is a system 
  where a player can vote once a day for seven days consistently, and on the seventh day they will receive five credits instead of one for 
  their vote. If a player misses even one day their streak resets. If a player is caught misusing the credit system in any way, they will be 
  unable to use the credit system moving forward.

<b><u> Hall of Fame </u></b>
<p> 2009scape is a free to play game allowing players to take their time leveling their player's stats. What is the fun of multiplayer if there isn't a little 
  bit of competition? Hall of fame or HoF for short, is a contest to see who will reach the first to a 99 in a skill. There is no reason to panic, there is a HoF for 
  every xp rate and ironman status. In order to claim a HoF spot, you must post inside of #claim-to-fame on discord or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!MGgWXBoZKgFDgtSGwS:matrix.vddcore.eu?via=matrix.vddcore.eu&via=matrix.org">#claim-to-fame</a> 
  on matrix. <b>The first to claim the 99 in the channel is the one who receives the credits and fame.</b> 
<br> 
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>x1 xp rate</b>: 200 credits</li>
<li><b>x2.5 xp rate</b>: 100 credits</li>
<li><b>x5 xp rate</b>: 40 credits</li>
<li><b>x10 xp rate</b>: 20 credits ( For Permadeath Ironmen only )</li>

</ul>
</p>
<b><u> JSON Contributions </u></b>
<p>
  If you are wanting to contribute the smaller easy but yet super imporant stuff look no further than the Json side. What can you 
  contribute through Json you may ask? There are examines, npc stats, npc drops, item drops, and even item spawns you can fill out. 
  Check out our Thanos Tool in order to get started. It's a fill-in-the-blank tool that does just that. Make sure that the Information
  is authentic to the 2009 era. 
  <br>

</p>
<b><u> Quest Dialogue </u></b>
<p>
  The 2008/2009 era of RS was a long while ago; however, some youtubers will have quite a bit of video guides in which you are to pull dialogue from.
  You can use OSRS as a last alternative if not found elsewhere for secondary options. I must advise against using it as your first choice as OSRS has 
  quite a bit of undocumented changes.  We know that writing dialogue is tedious and for this the reward is 10 credits per dialogue file written. 
  If you are unsure where to start, check out the #dev channel on Discord. If you are a Matrix user, you can check with the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#_discordpuppet__857696864777928754:matrix.vddcore.eu">Dev Channel</a>.
</p>

<b><u>Testing Content</u></b>
<p>
  With our new test server, we are able to test content on a server to make sure bugs do not enter the realm of the live server. We 
  can but do not want to do this alone and would love the help! But don't worry, there is something in it for you. Credits! Keep 
  in mind that credits will only be awarded to people who thoroughly test the content and provide detailed reports on them. Like 
  votes or HoF you must claim them inside of the #claim-to-fame channel on discord or matrix.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you test smaller things like bug fixes there is a 2 credit reward. <br>
  If you test full quests or minigames you will be rewarded 5 credits. <br> 
   If you find a bug in the content you are testing that hasn't already been found you will earn 
  an extra credit. <br> 
  <br> Super Easy! Get to testing!
</p>

<b><u> Events </u></b>
<p>
  To keep Community events alive we spark it up with some credits for attending. If you attend the event and participate you get a total of 2 points even 
  if you lose! Kermit, our event manager, gets to give out more credits to the winners of an official event. Once a week a player is able to make an 
  unofficial event and get 5 credits for hosting their own. It must be approved in order to get credits.
