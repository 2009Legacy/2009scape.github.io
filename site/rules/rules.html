<b>We have a simple set of rules. Before you get started, please read the following. We hope you enjoy your stay.</b>
</p>
<h3><b><u>1. Treat everyone in the community with respect.</u></b></h3>
<p>Disrespecting or harassing anybody in 2009Scape or its respective discord server is not tolerated. You may be kicked or banned.</p>
<h3><b><u>2. Requests for assistance must go via the Discord server.</u></b></h3>
<p>Do not message staff directly unless it is an emergency or you are reporting another user. If you have any questions, be sure to check the <a href="/site/help/faq.html">FAQ</a> first,
  common issues can be quickly resolved with the information provided. There are dedicated channels for receiving support in the Discord server. Support is also accessible via matrix if desired.</p>
<h3><b><u>3. Exploitation of bugs is strictly prohibited.</u></b></h3>
<p>If you happen to find a bug, report it <a href="https://gitlab.com/2009scape/2009scape/-/issues" target="_blank">here</a>. Exploitation of bugs will result in account deletion. We take this matter very seriously to maintain server integrity and maintain fair play environment.</p>
<h3><b><u>4. Bots and macros are strictly prohibited.</u></b></h3>
<p>Apart from our carefully controlled adventure bots that you'll see around the place, botting is strictly prohibited on the server. Bot, macro and autoclicker use will result in a ban.</p>
<h3><b><u>5. No soliciting closed source RSPS (or other related projects).</u></b></h3>
<p>We do not support any closed source RSPS. Do not mention them here. Do not recruit. Likewise, do not ask for paid services and do not ask to donate; this is a fair and free server.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 3%;"><i><b>Activity in 2009scape is monitored for violations of these rules. Severe violations may result in IP ban and account deletion.</b></i></p>
